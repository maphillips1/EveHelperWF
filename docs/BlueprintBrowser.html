                The Blueprint Browser is a utility that allows a user to view all current Blueprints and Reactions that are in Eve. When selected, it
                will give you the available job types for that blueprint, the materials required to complete that job, and if relevant, the profit you make
                and the return on investment (ROI). Note that I include reactions in this list.

            In the below screenshot, I've selected the Avatar to build. You can see that it tells you all of the materials
            you need on the right of the screen while allowing you to select where you're building it, what structure or station
            it's in, the ME/TE of the blueprint, etc. All of the pieces of information that could change the profit of the blueprint.

        <div class="InfoParagraph">
            The top right hand section of the screen is a summary of the input costs, the manufacturing cost, and the profit/loss.
            These values include any sales tax and broker fees. Broker fees only apply if you select the output order type as "Sell". If
            the output order type is "Buy", no broker fees are included. This is also true for calculating the input cost of the materials.

            <br /><br />

            Here's an example of the reactions page. Same concept as manufcaturing but the "System" dropdown is limited to any system with a
            security of 0.4 or lower since reactions can't be run in high sec.
