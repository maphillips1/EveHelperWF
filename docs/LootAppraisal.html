            The Loot Appraisal tool is a direct replacement for EvePraisal. It is a simple copy and paste loot on the left, click appraise in the middle
            and the value of the items is loaded on the right. 

            <br />
            You can copy and paste the contents of any item window in any satus and the parser *should* be able to parse it. There may still be some
            item formats that I haven't handled since every time you copy and paste from a different window in Eve, the format is slightly different.
