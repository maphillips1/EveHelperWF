            The System Finder tool is exactly what it sounds like. Given certain inputs, it looks for systems that match the criteria. 
            
            <br /><br />
            The criteria we can currently filter on is Planet Type, Security Status, Region, System Name Contains, Pochven, Wormholes. 

            <br /><br />
            The results are returned in the grid at the bottom of the screen. When you double-click a row, it will open a details screen that
            contains all the info you need about the system, as well as a link to ZKillboard, and Dotlan.
