            The Abyss Tracker is a tool designed to track your profts from running abyssal sites. The tool is relatively straightforward.

            <br />
            <br />
            On the left hand side of the screen, you input the details of your run. The type of abyss you ran (Level and Weather), the
            size of ship you ran (Determines filament cost on the right), whether the run was a success, and you can copy &amp; paste
            your loot. When you click "Add Run", it will add the abyss run to the right hand side of the screen. The history of your
            runs is also stored on the local file system, so if you close the app and come back, your progress is saved. I will also
            be adding a "Statistics" screen to track different stats for you in a later release.
            <br /><br />
            The Values on the right are auto-calculated and stored at the time you added the run. So for example, if you logged a "Cataclysmic Electrical"
            run on November First, with a cruiser, and a total loot value of 400 million isks, those values are stored and never reloaded. This way, if the
            value of abyss runs starts to increase, you will be able to see what you were getting vs what you're getting now.

            <br /><br />
            The filament cost is calculated by (Filament Lowest Sell order from Jita) * (Number of Filaments Needed for Ship Type). So for a cruiser,
            it's just the lowest sell order. For frigates, it's lowest sell order * 3. The abyssal loot value is determined by the (buy orders in Jita
            for the selected types) * (the quantity of each type). We do the buy value instead of sell value because sell values can be highly inflated
            and not realistic of what people are willing to pay for said item.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can also highlight and delete a run with the "Delete Run" button.
