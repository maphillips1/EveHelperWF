            The Build Plan control is by far the msot complicated screen of the entire app. It is highly configurable, stores the plans as files
            so that you can have different build plans with different settings, allows you to change everything about the build such as whether you're building
            all of the materials you can, or only a selection, same with reactions, where you're building it, the rigs, the prices you're paying,
            whether you're paying taxes, and how many runs/BP or reaction you want at a time. It then spits out an optimized build schedule that tells
            you what parts to make, what order to make them in, how long it will tkae, and every cost associated with it. It then takes all these
            numbers and tells you exactly how much profit you can expect. The whole point of industry is to be profitable and this tool is designed
            to let you tweak your build plan to make the most profit possible.

            <br />
            <br />
            On the left hand side of the screen, you can choose which tab to look at. there are 7 tabs.
            <ul>
                <li>Summary</li>
                <li>BP &amp; Reaction Settings</li>
                <li>System Structure and Order Type</li>
                <li>Materials &amp; Prices</li>
                <li>Build Details</li>
                <li>Planet Materials</li>
                <li>Cost Breakdown</li>
            </ul>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Top Panel</h4>
            At the very top of the build plan control, you will see the drop down to select an existing build plan, buttons for starting
            a new build plan or deleting one if you have it selected, the number of runs per copy and the number of copies, additional costs where
            you can type in the shipping cost, invention cost, or BP cost if you have to purchase it, and a price per item label.

            When you first load the screen, the drop down will contain nothing. Select "New Build Plan". Give it a name, select the item you
            want to build (searchable by typing), and hit save. This creates a brand new build plan for the item and starts working.
            <br /><br />
            Starting a new build plan will import your settings that you've cnofigured in the Settings page. If you have not configured any settings
            it will default a few things like the system of manufacturing to Jita, etc. If you want to save time on future plans, go to the <a href="DefaultConfiguration.html">Default Configuration</a>
            screen and set these values before you start the new build plan.

            <br /><br />
            The number of runs and runs per copy will always have at least 1. If you are building a plan for an inventable item, set the
            runs per copy to the outcome runs from the invention job. If you're unsure of this value, you can find this by visiting <a href="BlueprintBrowser.html">Blueprint Browser</a>
            search for the T1 bp, going to the invention tab, select the decryptor you want to use or "None" and it will tell you the number of runs per copy.

            <br /><br />
            Additional Costs is solely there for adding in any costs associated with this build plan that is not accounted for. The build plan accounts for
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Material Costs - based on order type selected</li>
                <li>Manufacturing or Reaction Job Costs</li>
                <li>Taxes - Both on buying the materials and selling the final product and the taxes from starting an indy job.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Additional costs could be
            <ul>
                <li>Blueprint Copy Cost - Especially useful for faction/pirate faction ships</li>
                <li>Shipping Costs - The summary page does give you the volume of the inputs and outputs for reference</li>
                <li>Invention Costs - In the future, this will be accounted for on an invention screen similar to the Blueprint Browser today.</li>
            </ul>
            <br /><br />
            Cost Per item is the total price that it took <b>Per Item</b> that it took to build. This includes all costs input above in the 
            additional costs field, the calculated costs from the build plan, and any taxes associated with selling the item. This is meant 
            to show you theh "Floor" of what your item is worth. It's useful for quickly seeing what the cost per item you should look for 
            on the market.
