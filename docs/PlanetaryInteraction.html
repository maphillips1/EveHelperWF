    <div class="InfoParagraph">
        The Planetary Interaction tool is a guide on how to build anything that is able to be built on planets. It is not a detailed planner of
        Build these items on these planets, export here, import here, and build here for max profit. It is a guide on "If you want to make Broadcast
        Node, here is the build tree from Raw Resources (P0) to the final product of Broadcast Node(P4)." This tool is similar to Alysii's PI Scheme.

        <br />
        <br />
        This tool also has a list of minimum planets required to manufacture the product on the right hand of the screen. This list is not perfect.
        For example, it my be better to have a different combination of planets than what's listed for the best outcome, but again, it's more of a guide.

        <br />
        <br />
        The 'Find System' button on the right hand side is a link to the <a href="SystemFinder.html">System Finder</a> tool to help you find
        a system in Eve that has the planets you need to make this product in one system. Evemus used to be able to do this, but that website has
        also gone dark.
