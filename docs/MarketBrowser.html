            The Market Browser tool allows you to view the buy orders, sell orders, and price history for any item in Eve in any region and system.
            You can also have multiple windows open at the same time allowing you to view two different markets for the same item at the same time.
            If you're a trader, this tool will most likely be the highest interest for you.
            <br /><br />

            The buy and sell orders window is straight forward. Sell orders on top are listed in prices ascending meaning lowest value at top. Just like in the Eve client.
            The buy orders are listed in most valuable at top.

            <br /><br />
            Price history in this app will be something that is unique from other apps like EveMarketer.com. CCP by default only provides the price history
            for an item for the past one year. Anything before that is lost. With this app, in order to give you the best experience, I store the price history
            of every item on your local machine and when you go back to view the item, I load both what you viewed previously, and any new information that CCP
            has provided.

            <br /><br />
            This means that as you use this over months/years, the price history of each item will show you the history from more than one year ago.
            If you use the <a href="PriceHistoryUtility.html">Price History Tool</a>, you can track certain items and update their price history with
            the click of a button. More on that in the linked page. I also plan on adding a chart view similar to the Eve client so you can see trends
            without just reading the numbers. That will be in a future release.

            <br /><br />
            Please note that due to limitations of the ESI, we are not able to see market orders for items in a structure. In order for that functionality to work
            I would need to add the ability for you to login with your Eve online character and then pull data from the character ESI. I never intend for this
            app to have any character login data because of the complexity and maintenance. This app is designed to be as maintenance free as possible and
            character level ESI data does not fit with that view.
