                Install Directions
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the zip file from the dropbox link above</li>
                <li>Extract the files</li>
                <li>Go into the folder and click the file named "setup". This is the installer.</li>
                <li>
                    The installer may ask you to install some desktop runtime libraries, currently, .net 7. This is just Microsoft code that does not
                    normally come with your base install of windows but the app needs it to run correctly. Install this dependency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After all dependencies have been installed, a second window will ask you to install the app. Since this is a beta release
                    you will get a warning saying the publisher couldn't be verified. This is because I have not gotten a security certificate. This is ok for now.
                    When I do the full release after beta testing is complete, the app will get a certificiate.
                </li>
                <li>Once the app is installed, it will auto-run. You can access it anytime by searching for 'EveHelper' in the start menu.</li>
                <li>Done. ENjoy the app.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Shopping List - A standalone window where you can add items from other utilities like the Blueprint Browser
                    and then mark off the items as you buy them
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blurpint and Reaction Build Plan - For more complicated builds like Tech II, Capitals, and advanced reactions, this utility will allow you to construct a
                    step-by-step plan for building from bought resources to the final product.
                </li>
                <li>Self-Updating guide - A guide that walks you through how to update the app yourself from within the app.</li>
                <li>A true installer instead of a click-once application</li>
                <li>
                    Separating the static data SQLite file from the installer so I can host the installer on github instead of dropbox. This
                    would also allow for more seamless updating and even updating from within the app.
                </li>
                <li>Version checking for auto-updates. Similar to other apps, add a way to tell you you're missing an update.</li>
                <li>Report Bug Screen</li>

                What is Eve Helper?
            </h4>
            Eve Helper is a companion app to Eve Online, developed by CCPGames. I created this app to replace a myriad of tools that used to be
            hosted online by various third party developers which have since gone dark.

            <br /><br />

            <h4>
                Why a Windows app and not a website?
            </h4>
            Websites cost money to maintain, apps deployed like this don't. I do this in my spare time for myself. I'm only deploying this because
            other people showed interest. In addition, if I take a break from Eve and decide not to udpate the app, you can update it yourself. No
            need for me. More on that later.

            <br /><br />

            <h4>
                What does this app do?
            </h4>
            This app currently has the the below tools.

            <ul>
                <li>Blueprint Browser - Blueprint Cost Calculator. Includes Research, Manufacturing, and Reactions</li>
                <li>Planetary Interaction Guid - Gives a list of items you can produce on planets and shows you the build tree for how to make it</li>
                <li>System FInder - Helps you find systems with matching criteria.</li>
                <li>Loot Appraisal - Copy and paste items from Eve and I give you the market value</li>
                <li>Market Browser - Allows you to lookup items on the market. Also captures price history.</li>
                <li>Price History Utility - Allows you to download price history data and view it for items.</li>
                <li>Abyss Tracker Utility - Allows you to track the profit you're making in the Abyss</li>
                <li>Default Configuration - Allows you to configure defaults used elsewhere in the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <br /><br />

            <h4>
                How do I update the app myself?
            </h4>
            The app is built to use the static data dump SQLite file that is provided by fuzzworks. This means that if you want to update the app
            to use the new data from a new expansion, all you have to do is go and download the new static data SQLite file from Fuzzworks website
            and then replace the current file the app is using. I will be adding a built-in method that allows you to do this without knowing where the apps
            files are located. This way you can download the SDE dump and then select the file from your downloads folder.
