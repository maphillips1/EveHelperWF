    <h1>
        What is Eve Helper?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Eve Helper is a companion app to Eve Online, developed by CCPGames. I created this app to replace a myriad of tools that used to be
        hosted online by various third party developers which have since gone dark.

     <h1>
         Why a Windows app and not a website?
     </h1>
    <p>
        Websites cost money to maintain, apps deployed like this don't. I do this in my spare time for myself. I'm only deploying this because
        other people showed interest. In addition, if I take a break from Eve and decide not to udpate the app, you can update it yourself. No 
        need for me. More on that later. 
    </p>

    <br />

    <h1>
        What does this app do?
    </h1>
    <p>
        This app currently has the the below tools. 

        <ul>
            <li>Blueprint Browser - Blueprint Cost Calculator</li>
            <li>Planetary Interaction Guid - Gives a list of items you can produce on planets and shows you the build tree for how to make it</li>
            <li>System FInder - Helps you find systems with matching criteria.</li>
            <li>Loot Appraisal - Copy and paste items from Eve and I give you the market value</li>
            <li>Market Browser - Allows you to lookup items on the market. Also captures price history.</li>
            <li>Default Configuration - Allows you to configure defaults used elsewhere in the app.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br />
    <h1>
        How do I update the app myself?
    </h1>
    <p>
        The app is built to use the static data dump SQLite file that is provided by fuzzworks. This means that if you want to update the app
        to use the new data from a new expansion, all you have to do is go and download the new static data SQLite file from Fuzzworks website
        and then replace the current file the app is using. I will be adding a built-in method that allows you to do this without knowing where the apps
        files are located. This way you can download the SDE dump and then select the file from your downloads folder.

    <h1>
        More detailed information about each tool.
    </h1>
    <h3>
        <a href="BlueprintBrowser.html">Blueprint Browser</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        This tool gives you a list of blueprints in a tree view. When you select one ( reactions included ), the panel on the right will give you all of the
        materials needed to build the item, and based on selections on the screen, the costs involved. 

        <br />The cost of manufacturing for example includes
        <ul>
            <li>The cost of the materials needed</li>
            <li>THe manufacturing cost based on the System Cost Index (value provided by Eve) and the Adjusted Cost of the product (also given by Eve).</li>
            <li>The sales tax when you sell the item on the market.</li>
        </ul>
        The tool takes all of this information and tells you if you will make a profit on the item or lose isk. It also gives you the Return on Investment value
        and the profit per hour value. True min-maxers care most about these.
