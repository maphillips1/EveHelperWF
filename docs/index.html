    </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kbmei1nm92wou95scxaio/EveHelper-ClickOnce-Version-1.0.1-BETA.zip?rlkey=myjbm803dt0de4brqookeuxqm&dl=0">Dropbox download link.</a>
        <br />
        The app is currently downloaded from dropbox due to file size limitations on the free version of GitHub. I plan to fix this in the future
        and allow you to download the app from github which would then download the static data file separately post-install, but for now, this is
        what we've got.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Install Directions
    </h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the zip file from the dropbox link above</li>
            <li>Extract the files</li>
            <li>Go into the folder and click the file named "setup". This is the installer.</li>
            <li>
                The installer may ask you to install some desktop runtime libraries, currently, .net 7. This is just Microsoft code that does not
                normally come with your base install of windows but the app needs it to run correctly. Install this dependency.
            </li>
            <li>
                After all dependencies have been installed, a second window will ask you to install the app. Since this is a beta release
                you will get a warning saying the publisher couldn't be verified. This is because I have not gotten a security certificate. This is ok for now.
                When I do the full release after beta testing is complete, the app will get a certificiate.
            </li>
            <li>Once the app is installed, it will auto-run. You can access it anytime by searching for 'EveHelper' in the start menu.</li>
            <li>Done. ENjoy the app.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>
        What is Eve Helper?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Eve Helper is a companion app to Eve Online, developed by CCPGames. I created this app to replace a myriad of tools that used to be
        hosted online by various third party developers which have since gone dark.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>
        Why a Windows app and not a website?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Websites cost money to maintain, apps deployed like this don't. I do this in my spare time for myself. I'm only deploying this because
        other people showed interest. In addition, if I take a break from Eve and decide not to udpate the app, you can update it yourself. No
        need for me. More on that later.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>
        What does this app do?
    </h2>
    <p>
        This app currently has the the below tools.

        <ul>
            <li>Blueprint Browser - Blueprint Cost Calculator</li>
            <li>Planetary Interaction Guid - Gives a list of items you can produce on planets and shows you the build tree for how to make it</li>
            <li>System FInder - Helps you find systems with matching criteria.</li>
            <li>Loot Appraisal - Copy and paste items from Eve and I give you the market value</li>
            <li>Market Browser - Allows you to lookup items on the market. Also captures price history.</li>
            <li>Price History Utility - Allows you to download price history data and view it for items.</li>
            <li>Default Configuration - Allows you to configure defaults used elsewhere in the app.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        How do I update the app myself?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The app is built to use the static data dump SQLite file that is provided by fuzzworks. This means that if you want to update the app
        to use the new data from a new expansion, all you have to do is go and download the new static data SQLite file from Fuzzworks website
        and then replace the current file the app is using. I will be adding a built-in method that allows you to do this without knowing where the apps
        files are located. This way you can download the SDE dump and then select the file from your downloads folder.
