            <h4>What is EveHelperWF</h4>
            <br />
            EveHelperWF is a companion app that I've written for the game Eve Online by CCP Games.  It hosts a collection of tools that I've
            found to be useful in my Eve Career.
            <br />
            <h4>What tools are there?</h4>
            <br />
            The current tools are

            <h4>Why EveHelper? There are tools online or I have my own spreadsheets</h4>
            <br />
            There are tools online, but online tools disappear. There have been several Eve tools that were hosted and then had to shut down
            due to costs. Making tools for Eve Online doesn't bring in any money in and of itself. A lot of revenue is due to ads and a lot
            of Eve players have ad blockers. This resutls in a website running at a huge loss and just not being maintainable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sometimes developers also just go inactive and stop playing Eve. This means that someone else has to take over the code and maintenance
            or the program just dies. More often than not, it's the latter. EveHelper limits this impact because you can udpate it yourself. See
            details on the Self Update page.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>But my spreadsheets are better optimized!</b> They probably are. But not everyone is you. There are a ton of Eve Players who
            want the benefits of a spreadsheet but don't have the knowledge or energy to make them. Specialized spreadsheets will always be better
            than any app that anyone can write. The benefit of this app is that I get you 95% of the way there with minimal work on the users end.
            How many times have CCP released a new ship or module, or have flat out changed Indy requirements? How many times has that royally fucked
            your spreadsheet and you've spent hours fixing it? Since this app is fed by static data, I take that out of the equation. New ships, modules,
            or changes in requirements? Update the app and it does all the hard work for you. The limiting factor is how long it takes to get the SDE converted
            into the SQLite database that this app consumes. That depends on two things. 1.) how long CCP takes to release the new SDE and 2.) How
            long it takes Fuzzworks to convert it. Eventually, I'll write my own conversion program and take that out of the equation.

                Install Directions
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the zip file from the dropbox link above</li>
                <li>Extract the files</li>
                <li>Go into the folder and click the file named "setup". This is the installer.</li>
                <li>
                    The installer may ask you to install some desktop runtime libraries, currently, .net 7. This is just Microsoft code that does not
                    normally come with your base install of windows but the app needs it to run correctly. Install this dependency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After all dependencies have been installed, a second window will ask you to install the app. Since this is a beta release
                    you will get a warning saying the publisher couldn't be verified. This is because I have not gotten a security certificate. This is ok for now.
                    When I do the full release after beta testing is complete, the app will get a certificiate.
                </li>
                <li>Once the app is installed, it will auto-run. You can access it anytime by searching for 'EveHelper' in the start menu.</li>
                <li>Done. Enjoy the app.</li>
