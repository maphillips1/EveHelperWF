 Companion App to Eve Online

 This app is released under the GNU General Public License v3. 

 This app includes many tools that I've needed trhough my Eve career. I wanted one central location, offline
 that allowed a person playing Eve to access data that you can't get trhough the in-game client, or you would
 have to have an alt sitting in a particular location. 

 I wanted this app to be offline because of the amount of tools that were previously released but have since
 stopped operating because of the cost of owning and running a website. I wnated anyone who uses this app 
 to be able to update the app themselves as well. In this version, I'm using the SQLite database provided
 by Fuzzworks as the backend data storage in addition to local files. This means that the user can just
 go and download the new version of the SDE, run the update utility that I provided, and then continue 
 using the tool with all the latest data. 

 I also open-sourced this application so that anyone who wants to maintain it if I were to step away, could. 
 I've seen numerous tools stop updating simply because the person who developed it stopped playing Eve and
 no longer cared. 

 In short, I hope that anyone who uses this app enjoys it, and continues enjoying it for the rest of their
 Eve career whether or not I'm playing Eve.
